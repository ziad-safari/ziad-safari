### Hello :)

My name is Ziad Safarjalani. I am currently a second year student studying Mathematics at UWaterloo.
I like to program and use any new knowledge I gain to improve my software abilities.

ðŸ’¬ I really enjoy working out, rock climbing and playing the piano. Shostakovich is my favourite and
